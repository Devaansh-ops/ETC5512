## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

```{r}
# Calculate the sum of 1 to 10
sum(1:20)


```

This is the file before creating a new branch (testbranch).

```{r}
# New Section in Test Branch

# Calculating the mean of a vector

mean(c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50))
```
