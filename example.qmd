## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

```{r}
# Calculate the sum of 1 to 10
sum(1:10)
```

```{r}
#Alternate section in main branch creating conflict
# Calculate the standard deviation of a vector
sd(c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50))

sum(1:10)

```

This is the file before creating a new branch (testbranch).

```{r}
# New Section in Test Branch

# Calculating the mean of a vector

mean(c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50))
```

```{r}
##Adding a new section with a plot.

#Data Visualisation

x <- 1:10
y <- x^2
plot(x, y, 
     main="Simple Square Function",
     xlab="X Values", 
     ylab="Y = XÂ²",
     col="blue",
     pch=16)
```
